            <p class="paragrafo">The name “Nagi” comes from “Nagisa”, which means “Beach” and “Coast” in Japanese.
                I started using it 7 years ago because of a cartoon I watched as a teenager and I got used to being called that.
                As I live on an island and almost studied Oceanography, the name seems even more suitable. Haha<br><br>
                My real name is João Pedro (John Peter, in english) and I'm 20 years old. I am studying Economic Sciences,
                but I already studied a degree in Mathematics which I abandoned in favor of economics.
                I've discovered a certain appreciation for programming in the meantime, 
                so I have plans to pursue a graduate degree in Data Science when I finish college.<br><br>
                I am a Buddhist, following mainly the Zen Buddhism's perspective and in particular the Soto Shu School. I like reading
                <b>A Doutrina de Buda</b>, which I think is great introductory material. <br><br>
                I'm currently taking a javascript fullstack programming course on Udemy and getting ready to start researching to write
                my monograph, which I should present in the first half of 2025.
